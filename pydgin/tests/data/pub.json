Alterations in the peripheral B cell compartment have been reported in T1D patients; however, to date, such studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by sample size. In this study, we have performed a detailed characterization of the B cell compartment in T1D patients (n\u2009=\u200945) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200946), and assessed the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 in purified B cells from the same donors. Overall, we found no evidence for a profound alteration of the B cell compartment or in the production of IL-10 in peripheral blood of T1D patients. We also investigated age-related changes in peripheral B cell subsets and confirmed the sharp decrease with age of transitional CD19(+) CD27(-) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) B cells, a subset that has recently been ascribed a putative regulatory function. Genetic analysis of the B cell compartment revealed evidence for association of the IL2-IL21\u2005T1D locus with IL-10 production by both memory B cells (P\u2009=\u20096\u00b74\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-4) ) and islet-specific CD4(+) T cells (P\u2009=\u20092\u00b79\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3) ). In contrast to previous reports, we found no evidence for an alteration of the B cell compartment in healthy individuals homozygous for the non-synonymous PTPN22\u2005Trp(620) T1D risk allele (rs2476601; Arg(620) Trp). The IL2-IL21 association we have identified, if confirmed, suggests a novel role for B cells in T1D pathogenesis through the production of IL-10, and reinforces the importance of IL-10 production by autoreactive CD4(+) T cells.", "suggest": {"input": ["Thompson", "Pekalski", "Simons", "Smyth", "Castro-Dopico", "Guo", "Guy", "Dunger", "Arif", "Peakman", "Wallace", "Wicker", "Todd", "Ferreira"]}},

However, the PTPN12 expression and its prognostic significance in HCC have not been well elucidated. In this study, tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) was investigated in an HCC cohort with adjacent liver tissues as controls. The resulting data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves, Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Our results showed that decreased expression of PTPN12 was more frequently observed in HCC tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Further correlation analyses indicated that the decreased PTPN12 expression was closely correlated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.015). Univariate analysis showed a significant association between decreased expression of PTPN12 and adverse cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival (P<0.001). In different subsets of overall patients, PTPN12 expression was also a prognostic indicator in patients with stage I/II or stage III/IV (P<0.05). Importantly, multivariate analysis (P<0.05) identified PTPN12 expression in HCC as an independent prognostic factor. Our findings provide a basis for the concept that PTPN12 protein expression is frequently decreased or lost in human HCC tissues and that decreased PTPN12 expression may represent an acquired recurrence phenotype of HCC and that PTPN12 expression may act as a biomarker of prognosis for patients with HCC.", "suggest": {"input": ["Luo", "Cai", "Li", "Fu", "Zhang", "Chen", "Cao", "Yun", "Xie", "Cai"]}},
