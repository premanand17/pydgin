	<h3>About ImmunoBase</h3>
		<p>ImmunoBase is a web based resource focused on the genetics and
			genomics of immunologically related human diseases. Our mission is to
			provide a curated and integrated set of datasets and tools to support
			and promote research in this area.</p>
		<p>The current focus of the site is to integrate and curate
			summary case/control association statistics from the consortium of 12
			diseases originally targeted by the ImmunoChip consortium. The
			following disease bar represents these 12 core diseases plus other
			diseases ('OD') of interest.</p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-12 text-center">{% show_disease_bar %}</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>GWAS studies are identified from the literature, that are associated
		with these diseases, and are curated to identify disease related regions.
		Using a selection of criteria this enables
		<strong>genes</strong> (<i>e.g. </i> <a href="/gene/ENSG00000134242/">PTPN22</a>),
		<strong>markers</strong> (<i>e.g. </i> <a href="/marker/rs2476601/">rs2476601</a>), and
		<strong>regions</strong> (<i>e.g. </i> <a href="/region/1p13.2_019/">1p13.2</a>) to be
		tagged with the disease(s). These criteria are used throughout
		the site to provide a disease bar for those features associated with the
		immunologically related human diseases.
		</p>
		<p>The site also includes software tools for analysing the data and can be found in the Tools menu.</p>
		<p>This web site was developed with support from the <a href="http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">
			Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation
			Laboratory</a>. This resource is maintained by the ImmunoBase team.
